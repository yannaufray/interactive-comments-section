## About The Project

The project started as a Frontend Mentor challenge. Frontend Mentor only provides the design and you need to code it from scratch using any technology you like.

I went quite a bit further and made the comments section responsive, and added transitions and new features such as current profile change. 

Here is what you can do:

* Create a new comment
* Reply to a comment
* Edit your comment
* Delete your comment
* Change current profile

The interactive comments section can be tested at [interactive-coms.netlify.app](interactive-coms.netlify.app/).
